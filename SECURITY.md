# Security Policy

Hi there! Since you are here, we guess that you either found a bug or that you want to hunt for them, which would be great!

## The Scope

All vulnerabilities or bugs are in scope, from Web to local to just strange missbehavior. Currently, there is only this Project in scope, but maybe there will come more:

| Target                          | Reward                                                                |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TulpApp (Android, IOs, Windows) | You'll be mentioned in the Credits Section  of the app if you want to |

Note that we are poor and can not give you money, even if we'd want to ðŸ˜“ Hopefully that won't make you demotivated to search for bugs!

## Contacting us

If you find a bug you can contact us over twitter (@TheGaiaSystem), reddit (u/GaiasSoul) or email (thegaiasystembugs@gmail.com).

## Rules

USERS MAY NOT BE HARMED!!! We want to see at least good effort to not compromise users! If you find a vulnerability where an account compromisation is not under your control 
(e.g. HTTP Request Smuggling, if we ever have a server), we understand that, however, DO NOT EXPLORE PROFILES THAT YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO! At the moment, the App works
completely offline so that there is no real possibility for problems like that, but who knows.

## Writing a report

Now that that is clear (which should've been clear from the beginning), we can talk about the look of your report. You may send it in as Video, Text with Pictures or just
Text, however, Video or Text with pictures is preferred (In case of text, please hand in a PDF). In that, you should include what this bug is, it's impact, how you found it/
steps to reproduce and maybe an idea how to fix the bug as well as a Proof of Concept (Altough the last two steps aren't required). It could take a while to fix the bug 
or to answer you, don't get discouraged.We also are a huge fan of full disclosure, but only after we fixed the bug, so before you show your amazing work to the world, give us
some time to fix the stuff and let the community update their software! After that happened, please ask us first and then the probability is pretty high that you may publish 
your work.

## Questions on the functioning of the app

You may ask any app-related questions with the help of the communication methods mentioned above (although we would be happy if you wouldn't use email for questions). We will
gladly help you understanding our messy work!
